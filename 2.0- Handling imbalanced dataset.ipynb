    "### Handling imbalanced dataset\n",
    "A key component of machine learning classification tasks is handling unbalanced, ehich is characterized by a skewed class distribution with a considerable overrepresentation of one class over the others. The difficulty posed by this imbalance is that models may exhibit inferior performance due to bias towards the majority classes."

It helps in creating new synthetic datasets for training machine learning models and to estimate the properties of a dataset when the dataset is unknown, difficult to estimate, or when the sample size of the dataset is small.\n"
